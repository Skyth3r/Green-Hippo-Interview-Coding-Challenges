# Green Hippo Interview Coding Challenges
For my application process at Green Hippo I went through a two stage interview. For each stage I was given a programming challenge to complete within a set time limit. These were my attempts to both the challenges at each stage of the interview.

## Stage One Challenge
For stage one, I was asked to create a function that  takes two parameters; a string and a 2D array of characters. The function is meant to search for a match of the string, vertically and horizontally. My solution is incomplete but can currently search the first row for the string horizontally.

## Stage Two Challenge
For the second stage of my interview I was asked to complete a challenge from [HackerRank](https://www.hackerrank.com). The challenge I was given was about virtual functions and can be found [here](https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/virtual-functions). My solution is complete and passed all the test cases presented on the website.
